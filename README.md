PROJECT DETAILS

We can refer this project to demonstrate react virtualized

---

Issue:

We might get issue while installing the library as it dont have offical support to latest react version,
to have work around install it as,
'npm install react-virtualized --legacy-peer-deps'
it worked for me but its not good practice, check if they provided support with latest react version
